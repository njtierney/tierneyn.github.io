My workflow in R now is to make a function after I copy and paste some code more than once. Sometimes I find myself using these functions more than once, across different projects.

So I decided to make an R package with a few of these functions in it. I call it "neato", in the vain hope that one day someone will find one of these functions and say: "neato!", because hey, it's pretty neat!

You can check neato out [here](https://github.com/tierneyn/neato).

I hope that the more I write into this package, the better I'll get at writing R packages and the more I can contribute to the R community. I'd also like to thank people like [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) and [Hilary Parker](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/) for writing materials to inspire me to contribute to R.

Let me know if you have any thoughts about it below with a comment, or even [on github](https://github.com/tierneyn/neato)
