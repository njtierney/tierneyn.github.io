title: Fix for `gbm.plot`

I'm currently in the process of writing a report using boosted regression trees.  I'm currently using guidelines provided by Elith et al [here](http://avesbiodiv.mncn.csic.es/estadistica/bt1.pdf), and [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/vignettes/brt.pdf)

They provide the function `gbm.step`, which performs 10-fold cross validation on the boosted regression tree. It also has a nifty `gbm.plot` function, producing partial dependence plots. Unforunately, it kept giving me this error:

> `Error: could not find function "windows"`

This means that the function `windows` is being called inside `gbm.plot`. So I looked into what the heck `windows` is and it turns out it opens a graphics device, but is the command reserved for windows machines - I use a mac, and the equivalent command is `X11()`. I found this out thanks to this website here: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com.au/2011/09/for-linux-macos-users-easy-fix-for.html

So I simply found the source code for gbm.plot, and replaced windows(...) with X11(...) Hopefully this will prove helpful to someone.
