Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the Queensland University of Technology. I am a Bayesian-Biostatistician-in-training.

My thesis is about creating better methods for modelling occupational health.

I am a passionate rock climber, music maker, [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04/), and coffee geek.

At the moment I'm transitioning [my website](njtierney.com) from wordpress to [GitHub](github.com), to something powered by Jekyll and Hyde.

Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:nicholas.tierney@gmail.com)
