<p>Welcome to my website.</p>

<p>My name is Nick. I am a PhD Candidate in Biostatistics at the Queensland University of Technology; a Bayesian-Biostatistician-in-training. My thesis is about creating better methods for modelling occupational health.</p>

<p>This website primarily exists so that I can share what I have learnt about statistics and programming with others.</p>

<p>Outside my PhD, I enjoy rock climbing in its various forms, playing guitar, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04/">taking photos</a>, and learning how to be a coffee geek.</p>

<p>At the moment I'm transitioning <a href="njtierney.com">my website</a> from wordpress to <a href="github.com">GitHub</a>. This new website is powered by <a href = "http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, using the <a href = "https://github.com/poole/lanyon" >lanyon</a> theme.

<p>Feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:nicholas.tierney@gmail.com">nicholas.tierney@gmail.com</a></p>
