My background is in Psychology.  I did my honours on human vision.  Now,  I'm  doing a PhD in Bayesian Biostatistics.  One of the first things that I noticed in my PhD journey is just how much more mathematics I'd need to get under my belt to tackle the problems that I wanted to tackle.  I'd done calculus in high school, and found that it was one area that had a clear APPLICATION to the real world.  But it was tricky and I was glad to be rid of it.

Not once in my Psych degree, in the four statistics courses, the 2 research methodology courses - did they ever mention that statistics involved calculus.

Statistics is essentially an application of calculus.

You need calculus if you want to do fancy statistics.

And no one told me.

I felt betrayed by my degree.  They had given me a smattering of statistics, but I felt unprepared for this world of bayesian statistics.

So last year I sat in on a first year algebra and calculus class.

It was...actually really fun.  I felt like a kid who had discovered that broccoli was actually delicious AND good for you.

As we went through the basics - solving linear equations, then how to find the maximum or minimum point in a function, how to solve a bunch of linear equations at the same time using matrix wizardry.  THIS was how you minimized error in a regression line.  It was all making sense - pieces were fitting into the puzzle.  The gaps that I thought existed from my stats learning in psych were being filled - and I realised more and more how much I needed to learn.

I was struck by a funny thought - in math you learn about a particular topic - say how to differentiate something from first principles.  It's quite involved and a bit tricky.  And then they hit you with a sweet shortcut that makes so much sense.

This trend continues.  Learn something.  Learn more about it.  Learn that it's quite tricky and involved.  Then learn some shortcut, or other way of solving the same problem.  Oh, and sidenote: this was all done like 200 years ago by some crazy french or german dude.

The soap-opera similarities begin when you tell someone who actually HAS a mathematics degree what you are up to.  They say something like:

"Ahhh...yes, that's really hard, but you wait - you'll learn how to do it quickly with <insert mathematician's name + Theorem>."

I feel like this is equivalent to saying that you are up to a point in a soap opera, or a book - and you tell someone who has finished it that: "Johnny has just said he's going to kill Alex!!"

And they reply:

"Oh...that's a good part, you just WAIT until you get the next chapter, everything starts to make sense."

And you're like:

"No way!"

And that's why I think mathematics is like a soap opera or an epic fantasy novel, or just a regular novel.
