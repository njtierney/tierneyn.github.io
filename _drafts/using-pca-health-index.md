How did I learn more?

And then I could answer questions like,

What is this factor analysis with PC extraction?

What is principal axes rotation?

What is an eigenvalue?

What is an eigenvector?

What does it mean to have the variance explained by a factor?

What is a rotation?



And, most importantly, how the hell do I construct an index?



Provide the code that allows you to do this in R.
