why-do-i-do-what-i-do

Today I had the wonderful pleasure of learning more about myself - I took a Myer-Briggs Personality Test.

I have a psychology degree with honours - I know of this test.  But I hadn't taken one.  And it made me excited - I got to see all of these other people learn more about themselves.

Then I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_YHVFoXkM">this video</a>.

And I tried to remind myself of why I do what I do.

Why am I doing statistics?

I mean, the **ultimate goal** is to become a powerhouse researcher, someone who doesn't need to rely on the skills of 'programmers' or 'statisticians' to do what I want - to work with public health data to inform policy.

That's the big picture.

But what about the small ones?

What can I do <strong>every day</strong>, to make the world better, to impact it positively?

One thing I think is to start writing <strong>here</strong> more often - this is more for myself.  I have discovered that I need to let out what is trapped in an undefined, mindless blob in my head, and spill it out onto the page and shape it into my ideas, ideals, and dreams.

That's the first tiny step - showing some love for myself.  To make myself progress.

The next is to do something positive for an individual or group.

This could be something as simple as:

-sending those postcards to my friends overseas.

-saying something sincere, and positive to someone.

-giving some money to a charity

- heling out a friend

- teaching someone something new (climbing, guitar, psychology).

- play music for people and <em>smile</em>.

I think that I'm going to get where I want to go in life.  I'm <strong>almost</strong> confident that it will work out. I don't for a minute think that it will be easy.  And I think that whilst it's important to stay focussed on the big picture - for me, influencing policy - it is <i>almost as important</i> to keep my eyes in front of me and do something every day to make the world a better place.
