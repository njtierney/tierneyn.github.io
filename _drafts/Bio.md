Where to start?

I am Brisbane born and bred. I entered Psychological Science at the University of Queensland in 2008, with visions of being a child psychologist. I wanted to make a difference to children's lives. However, my journey through my undergraduate was thoroughly augmented when I went on exchange to McGill University in Winter, 2010. This trip opened my eyes to the importance of travel for personal growth, that the outdoors were very important to me, and the thought that academia could take you places.

I made it into honours in psychology and finished in 2012 with a passion for research. This was surprising. What about my dreams of being a child psychologist? Was I wrong? No. I was just different. I realised the impact that good research could have - mainly because I took a class on public health psychology, headed by Professor Christina Lee. I also found that I enjoyed research because I had an amazing honours supervisor, Dr. Philip Grove.

So I left my undergraduate a little unsure on a specific area that I wanted to focus on, but knew that I was thoroughly interested in Public Health and Statistics. I found an opportunity at QUT for a research assistant in Statistics.  Shortly after I finished my RA work, I was offered an opportunity to do a PhD in statistics, which came complete with an industry scholarship - The Industry Doctoral Training Centre.

It's been a steep learning curve, as I grapple with the wonderful world of mathematics, statistics, and programming. I am surrounded by marvellous people in [Bayesian Research Analysis Group](http://bragqut.wordpress.com)(BRAG), who understand my battle against calculus, the syntax for the [statistical package "R"](http://cran.r-project.org/), and what it means to be a researcher.

My research involves creating statistical models describing occupational health.  I work with Professor Kerrie Mengersen, who provides me with statistical guidance, Dr. Fiona Harden, who informs me of the practical and clinical significance of my models, and Dr. Maurice Harden, an Occupational Physician who supplied the data and initial interest in this project, some 10 years ago.

I enjoy explaining the joys of statistics, especially to those who might despise the topic (I was once one of those people!).  It is my hope that I can make the secret labyrinth of statistics an easily accessible (or escapable) place, by providing various explanations of the complex (and not so complex) statistical concepts I come across.  Outside of stats I enjoy rock climbing, running, reading, riding my bike places (when it isn't broken), playing guitar, making coffee, taking photos, and travelling.

Hope you are having a swell day,

Nick.
