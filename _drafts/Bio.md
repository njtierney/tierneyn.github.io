Where to start?

I am Brisbane born and bred. I entered Psychological Science at the University of Queensland in 2008 with visions of being a child psychologist. However, my journey through my undergraduate was thoroughly augmented when I went on exchange to McGill University in Winter, 2010. This trip opened my eyes to the importance of things like travel, the outdoors, and gave me the idea that being an academic could take you places.

I finished my honours year in 2012 with a passion for research that would have surprised my first year self. This passion was largely realised through two avenues - 1. an excellent honours supervisor, Dr. Phil Grove, who gave me a project that got me excited. and 2. A class on public health psychology, by Professor Christina Lee, which showed me the broad and powerful implications of good health research.

After undergrad, I wanted to study more statistics - I wanted to be a bridge between policy and statistics, and to do that I'd need to understand the underlying math behind it all. I sought out a job doing health research and stats and found an opportunity at QUT as a research assistant in the statistics department.  After I finished the job, I was offered an opportunity to do a PhD in statistics, which came complete with an industry scholarship - The Industry Doctoral Training Centre. I officially began in May 2013, and have been enjoying the rollercoaster ride that is a PhD ever since.

It's been a steep learning curve, as I grapple with the wonderful world of mathematics, statistics, and programming. Fortunately, I am surrounded by marvellous people in [Bayesian Research Analysis Group](http://bragqut.wordpress.com)(BRAG), who have helped this poor kid from psychology understand complex mathematics, programming syntax, and how to be a great researcher.

My research involves creating statistical models describing th health of employees in worksites. I work with Professor Kerrie Mengersen, who provides me with statistical guidance, Dr. Fiona Harden, who informs me of the practical and clinical significance of my models, and Dr. Maurice Harden, an Occupational Physician who supplies the data and expert insight.

I enjoy explaining the joys of statistics, especially to those who might despise the topic (I was once one of those people!).  It is my hope that I can make the secret labyrinth of statistics an easily accessible place, by providing various explanations of the statistical concepts I come across.  Outside of stats I enjoy rock climbing, running, reading, riding my bike places (when it isn't broken), playing guitar, making coffee, taking photos, and travelling.

Hope you are having a swell day,

Nick.
