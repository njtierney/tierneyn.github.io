My general workflow in R is to make a function after I copy and paste some code more than once. Sometimes I find myself using these functions more than once, across different papers.

So I decided to make an R package with a few of these functions, called "neato". I called it this in the hope that one day someone will find one of these functions and say: "neato!", because hey, it's pretty neat!

You can check neato out <a href="https://github.com/tierneyn/neato">here</a>.

I hope that the more I write into this package, the better I'll get at writing R packages and the more I can contribute to the R community. I'd also like to thank people like <a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham </a>and <a href="http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">Hilary Parker</a> for writing materials to inspire me to contribute to R.

Let me know if you have any thoughts!
