I regret not studying more History.  But I regret a lot of things.

The year was 2005, Harry Potter wasn't quite finished, the iPhone hadn't come out, and I was required to choose electives for my subjects in grade 11 and 12.  I wasn't going to continue with woodwork, thought Film and TV would be too much work, and had to give PE a miss.  But I was tossing up between Modern History and our programming subject, Information Processing Technology (IPT).

What to choose?  IPT would obviously allow me to become the computer hacker guru that I had always wanted to be.  Modern history would allow me to ask critical questions, pull people up on misfacts, and maybe allow for sitting in an armchair, smoking a pipe, swilling (not swirling) brandy in a brandy balloon whilst <em>talking about things that other people didn't understand</em>.

I chose IPT.

This became satisfyingly important later on in life, but I wouldn't know that.

Modern History would have likely improved my writing and communication and critical reasoning and cultural awareness.

All very useful, really.

But I don't know that for sure - this is just me thinking now with 20:20 Hindsight; what I _imagine_ I would have learnt.

What I _do_ know is that IPT ended up being a whole lot of things that I was not expecting.

1. It was hard.

2. It was...weird and abstract.

3. It make me...think...differently.

Writing programs in _Delphi7_ meant that I was able to apply logical statements, and then see the fruit of what would otherwise be rather useless premises/propositions in an argument, for example:

```
"Select ARTIST in ALBUM

where ARTIST == "Queen"

and

YEAR == 1989"
```

It ended up being a lot of fun.  It was hard, but enjoyable, and rewarding and frustrating.  I had a good teacher to thank for this - Thanks, Peter Whitehouse.

I finished my senior year with a Sudoku generator game.  My brute force plan didn't work.  But no one else had tried it before so I earned points for being 'brave' and 'stupid'.  I later found out that Sudoku generators when first built, took several years to develop, and they are often used for assignments in first and second year university subjects.  So I felt a little silly, but a little bit awesome.

I didn't touch programming at all after I finished high school.

But a few years later while travelling in the USA, I learnt that history had the interesting effect of <em>making things meaningful</em>.

In the USA. Houses weren't just houses - they were some famous person's house.  Apparently he was important.  I wish I knew who he was.

Climbing.  This face here - right here.  Fred Fromm did this without a rope in RM williams.  This line - here - was the first 22 in Australia.  Look at it.

It turned a rock into a thing of art.

Putting things into context has made them something that they weren't before.

Putting things into context - into their <em>history</em> - breathes life into them.
