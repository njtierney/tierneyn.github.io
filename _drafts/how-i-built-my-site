How I built this website. An abridged version.

 My colleagues and I started using a [Slack]() - basically a work-chat thing. It has a really nifty feature where you can post chunks of code and share them. So I started sharing a lot of R code that I use, and I thought it might be start posting them up as little RMarkdown chunks onto my website njtierney.com, hosted on wordpress. This is a little tale of my success/woes on this.

I had seen some posts about using RMarkdown with wordpress, and Yihui (creator of knitr) has a guide for it:  http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/wordpress/ so I figured it couldn't be so bad. And it isn't too bad, really - the only short coming is that you need to post your images/figures onto imgur or dropbox...But it can be done  -as seen nicely here: https://yihui.wordpress.com/. So I was going to do that...

...But in his post, Yihui says:
Note you can write and preview the draft in RStudio until you are comfortable to publish it. Once it is published, it is not straightforward to modify it (although you can), and that is why you, as a cool hacker, should blog with Jekyll instead of WordPress. It is always easy to deal with plain text files. Once you have got PHP, MySQL, password, plugins, ... things get complicated quickly.

And I thought...Jekyll, eh? I had heard of Jekyll, but wasn't really sure what it was - but I knew that adv-r-had.co.nz can been built using it, so if Hadley Wickham was using it, and Yihui says it's good, I felt that I should look into using it.

Miles McBain and I started having a chat about it, and it turns out that it isn't too hard to make a site using jekyll. In fact, it is really easy, because GitHub will provide free hosting of one blog for you. https://pages.github.com/. It took about 30 seconds to make an absolutely barebones website. Literally, all it said, in stock font was "Hello World". You can then make a fully awesome website using Jekyll.

Jekyll basically allows you to write plain text posts and using some straightforward commands in the terminal like jekyll build and jekyll serve, it does all the hard work and builds the HTML code and everything needed to get the website to work.

The part

Basically, GitHub hosts the website for you, and you can use Jekyll to build the website content. The whole website can be made public on GitHub, so people can see exactly how everything works, and the whole website is stored locally, so I know exactly how everything works. It seems like a compromise between learning how to code a website from absolute scratch, and using a content management system like wordpress.  And I have control. Sounds good.

So I followed the instructions, and then wanted to make the website cool, so I downloaded the style "Hyde" from Poole - made by GitHub, and then produced this website: tierneyn.github.io

So now the plan is to work out how to write RMarkdown posts and put them onto the website. Which was the whole point of 


Step 1. Create a GitHub Account

Step 2. Create a github page - as per their instructions

Step 3. Download requirements for jekyll - link

Step 4. followed directions from this blog: http://www.sitepoint.com/set-jekyll-blog-5-minutes-poole/

Step 5. 

trying to get jekyll to work with RMarkdown

tried following steps on :

http://www.jonzelner.net/jekyll/knitr/r/2014/07/02/autogen-knitr/
http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/
But when I ran the code

```
_knitr/render_post.R _knitr/2015-10-25-first.Rmd
```

I got the error

```
Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection
Calls: KnitPost -> knit -> writeLines -> file
In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "w") :
  cannot open file '../_posts/2015-10-25-first.md': No such file or directory
Execution halted

```

Looking around, a lot of solutions involved a lot of code that I didn't understand, because my programming knowledge is limited to R.

I kept coming across this function `knitr::render_jekyll()` in the blog posts I was reading. To me, a function like

Here's a list of other blogs I've been reading to try and approach my problem:

**customizations**

I had a look around at a bunch of different blogs about how to build stuff

**getting a disqus comment feed**

1. Go to disqus, create account (if you haven't already)

2. go to settings (gear icon in the top right), and clikc "add disqus to site"

3. go to "engage", and fill in your site name, etc.

4. choose your platform - choose "universal code"

5. copy the code from disqus, being sure to [follow their instructions](https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2158629), to "Recommended) Edit the RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section using your CMS or platform's dynamic values. See our documentation to learn why defining identifier and url is important for preventing duplicate threads."

As Joshua Lande points out, this : "By setting up the code this way, I can enable commenting on a page-by-page basis. All I have to do is set "comments: True" in the YAML header of the post."

I then decided that I couldn't understand what disqus wanted me to do...so I copies Joshua Lande's text from his github repo, changed his name for mine, and continued on. Isn't that cool? Isn't that why GitHub is so awesome?
