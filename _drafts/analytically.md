What does analytical mean?  It's a fair question, as it's wikipedia page shows that there are many definitions

Wikipedia definition:

"Analytic Solution"

- A solution to a problem that can be written in "closed form" in terms of known functions, constants, etc.

I find that such a definition relies on the reader knowing what the words 'closed form', 'known functions' and 'constants' are.

So here's my definition:

"Analytic Solution"

A solution where everything needed to solve a particular question is presented clearly and logically, with all assumptions defined.
