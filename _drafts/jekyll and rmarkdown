I tried following steps on :

http://www.jonzelner.net/jekyll/knitr/r/2014/07/02/autogen-knitr/
http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/
But when I ran the code

```
_knitr/render_post.R _knitr/2015-10-25-first.Rmd
```

I got the error

```
Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection
Calls: KnitPost -> knit -> writeLines -> file
In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "w") :
  cannot open file '../_posts/2015-10-25-first.md': No such file or directory
Execution halted

```

Looking around, a lot of solutions involved a lot of code that I didn't understand, because my programming knowledge is limited to R.

I kept coming across this function `knitr::render_jekyll()` in the blog posts I was reading. To me, a function like
