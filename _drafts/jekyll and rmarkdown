trying to get jekyll to work with RMarkdown

tried following steps on :

http://www.jonzelner.net/jekyll/knitr/r/2014/07/02/autogen-knitr/

But when I ran the code

```
_knitr/render_post.R _knitr/2015-10-25-first.Rmd
```

I got the error

```
Error in file(con, "w") : cannot open the connection
Calls: KnitPost -> knit -> writeLines -> file
In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "w") :
  cannot open file '../_posts/2015-10-25-first.md': No such file or directory
Execution halted

```
