The word _latent_ is thrown around a lot in stats, and I've always been a little bit unclear on just what it means.

**The quick and dirty definition**

_Latent_ means something that is hidden, that cannot be measured, or is not yet fully developed.  So in reference to statistics, a latent factor is something that cannot be measured directly, like the size and location of a cancer tumor in the brain, which (usually) cannot be measured without killing the person.


**Other definitions.**

Google Defines it as an Adjective:

_Latent_

	- (of a quality or state) Existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden; concealed

	- (of a bud, resting stage, etc.) Lying dormant or hidden until circumstances are suitable for development or manifestation.


With the Synonyms:  hidden - secret - occult - delitescent - ulterio

In Psychology:

**The Dictionary of Psychoanalysis**

> p98 "[with reference to dreams]...**latent content** is its meaning as revealted by **interpretation**

**Theory and practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy**

> "[with reference to dreams ] **Latent Content** consists of hidden, symbolic, and unconcscious motives, wishes, and fears."


In statistics:

**Discovering statistics using SPSS**

> Latent variable:  A variable that cannot be directly measured, but is assumed to be related to several variables that can be measured.

Use it in a sentence

....


So there you have it.  Various definitions of latent.  Probably not worthy of a post, but I'm trying to develop a glossary of terms, so here I am.
