The word <em>latent</em> is thrown around a lot in stats, and I've always been a little bit unclear on just what it means.

<strong>The quick and dirty definition.</strong>

Basically, 'latent' means something that is hidden, that cannot be measured, or is not yet fully developed.  So in reference to statistics, a latent factor is something that cannot be measured directly, like the size and location of a cancer tumor in the brain, which (usually) cannot be measured without killing the person.


<strong>Other definitions.</strong>

Google Defines it as an Adjective:

<em>Latent</em>
<ol>
	<li>(of a quality or state) Existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden; concealed.</li>
	<li>(of a bud, resting stage, etc.) Lying dormant or hidden until circumstances are suitable for development or manifestation.</li>
</ol>
With the Synonyms:  hidden - secret - occult - delitescent - ulterio

<strong>In Psychology:</strong>

<strong> "The Dictionary of Psychoanalysis" :</strong>

p98 "[with reference to dreams]...<strong>latent content</strong> is its meaning as revealted by <strong>interpretation</strong>"

"<strong>Theory and practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy</strong>"

"[with reference to dreams ]<strong>Latent Content</strong> consists of hidden, symbolic, and unconcscious motives, wishes, and fears."

<strong>In statistics</strong>

"Discovering statistics using SPSS" - Andy Field...

"Latent variable:  A variable that cannot be directly measured, but is assumed to be related to several variables that can be measured."

<strong>Use it in a sentence.</strong>

....

&nbsp;

So there you have it.  Various definitions of latent.  Probably not worthy of a post, but I'm trying to develop a glossary of terms, so here I am.
